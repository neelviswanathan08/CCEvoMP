create_prediction_output
                        Create a beautiful output for model predictions
detect_patterns         Internal function to detect non-random events
                        in time series data This function is not meant
                        to be called directly by users. It is used
                        internally by analyze_stasis_trait,
                        analyze_urw_trait, and analyze_grw_trait.

                        simple model can be predicted
find_segment_end        Find the first time point where a simple model
                        can be predicted
predict_evolutionary_model

                        range
visualize_results       Visualize Control Chart Results with Detected
                        Patterns

                        not meant to be called directly by users. It is
                        used internally by analyze_entire_series.
